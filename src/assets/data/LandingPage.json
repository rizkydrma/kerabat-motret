Nah, let's go in for a virtual bear hug and a quick two-minute spiel about who I am, because who I am is your new hyper-talented mate – a creative director and visual connoisseur with a background and degree in commercial and photojournalistic photography.",
    "paragraf1": "As a multidisciplinary visual creator, I have a keen focus on film andan insatiable obsession with storytelling. I started out shooting weddings, where I learned the mystic and lesser-studied art of making people feel comfortable in front of a camera; from there I branched out into commercial work before founding my own production company, fēlan films (derived from the origin of the word ‘FEELING’...you feel?).  ",
    "paragraf2": "Collaboration is the lifeblood of the moving image and a large part of why I adore what I do. Our team learned so much through creating content for top-tier clients that we felt downright professorial and accepted our humble duty to share the fēlan genius with the masses.",
